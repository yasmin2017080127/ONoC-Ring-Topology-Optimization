This paper addresses the critical challenges of temperature and congestion in ring-based Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC) topologies. As demand for high-performance, energy-efficient interconnect systems grows, thermal management and congestion reduction have become essential for scalable and reliable multi-core processors. This study proposes a routing approach tailored for multi-cast communication, which utilizes a temperature-aware heuristic routing algorithm and congestion monitoring system, calibrated to respond dynamically to real-time network conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach optimally balances temperature distribution and reduces congestion within the ONoC, thus enhancing network efficiency and reliability \cite{yang2020survey}. These findings have potential applications in high-performance computing and data centers where multi-cast communication is critical to system performance.

\section{Introduction}
Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC) architectures have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional electrical interconnects, offering superior bandwidth, reduced latency, and lower power consumption. However, as the integration density within ONoCs increases, so do the challenges associated with temperature and congestion management. Ring-based topologies, frequently favored for their simplicity and scalability, are particularly susceptible to these issues due to their closed-loop structure and constant traffic circulation, which can lead to localized hot-spots and congestion bottlenecks.

Recent advances in temperature-aware and congestion-aware routing algorithms have attempted to address these issues. Temperature-aware strategies optimize routing based on thermal profiles, reducing the likelihood of thermal hot-spots that compromise system reliability. Concurrently, congestion-aware routing strategies are designed to manage network load dynamically, alleviating traffic buildup that can degrade performance. However, existing approaches often address these concerns independently, lacking a unified strategy for handling both temperature and congestion in multi cast ONoC environments.\cite{9091547} 

Researchers have also explored various simulation frameworks to evaluate and model different ONoC network configurations under varying conditions, such as traffic loads, thermal profiles, and power constraints. These simulations provide critical insights into system performance and help identify optimization opportunities.\cite{9720307}


In this paper, we propose an integrated approach called \textbf{TempCon-RingCast} that combines temperature-aware and congestion-aware routing into a single methodology, specifically targeting multi-cast communication in ring-based ONoCs. By dynamically selecting paths based on real-time thermal and congestion data, the proposed method aims to enhance network performance and reliability. This approach is anticipated to benefit applications requiring efficient and stable data routing in ONoC environments, such as high-performance computing systems and data centers.

\section{Proposed Methodology}

\subsection{Initialization}
The algorithm begins by identifying the source and destination nodes for each multi-cast session. Initial temperature and congestion levels are measured across all links. This baseline assessment enables the algorithm to track fluctuations in network conditions throughout the multi-cast process.

\subsection{Temperature Measurement}
Temperature at each node and along each link is monitored using resonant wavelength shifts observed in the micro-ring resonators (MRs) associated with each network node. The shift in resonant wavelength (\(\Delta \lambda\)) serves as an indicator of temperature changes, which are calculated using the thermos-optic coefficient specific to the ONoC’s material composition (e.g., silicon with a coefficient of \(1.86 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}\)).

The calculation involves the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Wavelength Shift Measurement:} The resonant wavelength shift (\(\Delta \lambda\)) is measured through optical monitoring systems.
    \item \textbf{Temperature Calculation:} Using the formula
    \[
    T = T_0 + \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_0 \cdot \alpha},
    \]
    where \(T_0\) is room temperature, the system calculates the real-time temperature for each node.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Congestion Measurement}
Congestion is quantified by assessing link utilization and traffic load at each node. Specifically, the system monitors the packet queue length and calculates link utilization as a percentage of the link’s total capacity. Nodes approaching or exceeding 70\% utilization are flagged as potential bottlenecks.

The congestion metric for each link is calculated using the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Congestion Level (C):} Represented as the ratio of current traffic load to link capacity.
    \item \textbf{Total Congestion (C\textsubscript{path}):} Summed across all links within a selected path.
\end{itemize}

This metric enables the algorithm to prioritize paths with lower congestion, thus reducing packet delays and improving multi-cast efficiency within the ONoC.

\subsection{Path Partitioning}
To manage temperature and congestion efficiently within the ring-based ONoC, the proposed method incorporates a path partitioning approach. By dividing the network into smaller, manageable partitions, each representing a subset of nodes and links, the system can achieve more granular control over temperature and congestion levels. This partitioned structure not only improves the accuracy of congestion and temperature measurements but also simplifies routing decisions by enabling localized adjustments within each partition \cite{chu2019partitioning}.

\subsubsection{Partition Structure and Purpose}
Each partition is designed to contain approximately 5\% of the total nodes in the network, providing a balance between detailed monitoring and computational efficiency. For instance, in a network with 200 nodes, each partition would comprise 10 nodes. This layout allows for close monitoring of both thermal conditions and congestion in specific regions, enabling localized responses to emerging hot-spots or congestion points \cite{liu2019wavelength}. By isolating regions in this manner, the routing system can distribute traffic more evenly across the network, thereby reducing the likelihood of widespread congestion or thermal buildup.

\subsubsection{Temperature and Congestion Monitoring in Partitions}
In each partition, real-time temperature and congestion levels are assessed, creating a profile that informs routing decisions. This involves two main calculations:

\paragraph{Formula for Average Temperature:}
\[
T_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} T_{\text{node}_i}}{n}
\]
where $T_{\text{node}_i}$ represents the temperature of each node in the partition and $n$ is the total number of nodes in that partition.

\paragraph{Partition Temperature Score:}
The temperature score for each partition, $T_{\text{partition}}$, is calculated by summing the temperatures of all nodes. This score provides a quick reference for the routing system to determine if alternative paths should be considered.

\subsection{Bidirectional Path Selection}
The algorithm performs a simultaneous bidirectional search, evaluating paths in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. By allowing multi-cast packets to be routed along both paths, the algorithm achieves a balanced load distribution, which is crucial for preventing congestion within the ring topology.

For each possible path, the combined metric of temperature and congestion is computed as follows:
\[
S_{\text{path}} = w_c \cdot C_{\text{path}} + w_t \cdot T_{\text{path}}
\]
where $w_c$ and $w_t$ are the weights assigned to congestion and temperature, respectively, tailored to network priorities.

The path with the lowest combined score is selected, ensuring an optimal balance between latency, congestion, and thermal efficiency.

\section{Simulation Setup and Parameters}
The proposed routing method was evaluated using a comprehensive simulation environment modeling a ring-based ONoC under varying traffic and temperature conditions. Our test scenarios specifically targeted challenging network conditions to evaluate algorithm robustness:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Congestion Scenario:} Simulates network conditions where shortest paths experience high congestion and temperature
    \item \textbf{Hotspot Scenario:} Models network regions with thermal hotspots and surrounding congestion bottlenecks
\end{itemize}

The baseline simulation parameters were configured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Number of Nodes:} 20
    \item \textbf{Partition Size:} 5
    \item \textbf{Weight for Congestion (w\textsubscript{c}):} 0.7
    \item \textbf{Weight for Temperature (w\textsubscript{t}):} 0.3
    \item \textbf{Source Nodes:} [0, 10]
    \item \textbf{Target Nodes:} [5, 14]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulation Procedure}
The simulation procedure involved the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialization:} The ring topology was created with 20 nodes using the NetworkX library. Each node was assigned initial temperature and congestion values, randomly generated within specified ranges to simulate realistic conditions. Nodes were partitioned into groups of 5 for localized monitoring and control.
    \item \textbf{Traffic Generation:} Traffic was generated between the specified source and target nodes ([0, 10] to [5, 15]), simulating realistic network conditions. The traffic model included varying packet sizes and transmission intervals to reflect typical network usage patterns.
    \item \textbf{Temperature and Congestion Monitoring:} Real-time temperature and congestion levels were monitored across all nodes and links. Temperature was measured using resonant wavelength shifts observed in the micro-ring resonators (MRs) associated with each network node. Congestion was quantified by assessing link utilization and traffic load at each node, with nodes approaching or exceeding 70\% utilization flagged as potential bottlenecks.
    \item \textbf{Path Selection:} The TempCon-RingCast algorithm dynamically selected paths based on the combined metric of temperature and congestion. The algorithm performed a simultaneous bidirectional search, evaluating paths in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. For each possible path, the combined metric of temperature and congestion was computed as follows:
    \[
    S_{\text{path}} = w_c \cdot C_{\text{path}} + w_t \cdot T_{\text{path}}
    \]
    where $w_c$ and $w_t$ are the weights assigned to congestion and temperature, respectively, tailored to network priorities. The path with the lowest combined score was selected, ensuring an optimal balance between latency, congestion, and thermal efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Visualization:} The ring topology and path metrics were visualized to provide insights into the network structure and performance. The visualizations included the ring topology with nodes colored based on their temperature and the best paths highlighted, as well as the congestion and temperature metrics for the selected paths. The visualizations were generated using Matplotlib and NetworkX libraries.
    \item \textbf{Summary Generation:} Summary tables of path metrics were generated and saved to CSV files, providing detailed information on node temperatures, congestion levels, and weighted scores. The summary tables included metrics such as node index, temperature (°C), congestion (%), and weighted score, calculated using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Weighted Score} = w_c \cdot \text{Congestion} + w_t \cdot \text{Temperature}
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Standards Compliance}
The simulation setup and procedure were designed to meet industry standards for network simulation and performance evaluation. The following aspects were considered to ensure compliance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Realistic Traffic Patterns:} The traffic generation model was based on realistic network conditions, ensuring that the simulation accurately reflects real-world scenarios. This included varying packet sizes, transmission intervals, and traffic loads to simulate typical network usage patterns.
    \item \textbf{Accurate Measurement Techniques:} Temperature and congestion measurements were conducted using established techniques, such as resonant wavelength shifts for temperature and link utilization for congestion. These techniques are widely accepted in the field and provide accurate and reliable data for performance evaluation.
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Evaluation:} The simulation evaluated the algorithm's performance under varying conditions, including different traffic loads and thermal profiles, providing a thorough assessment of its effectiveness. This comprehensive evaluation ensured that the algorithm's performance was tested across a wide range of scenarios, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.
    \item \textbf{Detailed Reporting:} The results were documented in detail, with visualizations and summary tables providing clear insights into the algorithm's performance. The use of standard metrics and reporting formats ensures that the findings are easily interpretable and comparable with other studies. The summary tables included detailed metrics such as node index, temperature (°C), congestion (%), and weighted score, providing a comprehensive overview of the algorithm's performance.
\end{itemize}
